Compilation

Server Compilation
 - Open a terminal.
 - Navigate to the directory containing server.c.
 - Compile the server code using the following command:
	
	gcc server.c -o uniqueserver


Client Compilation
 - Open a new terminal (or use the same one).
 - Navigate to the directory containing client.c.
 - Compile the client code using the following command:

	gcc client.c -o client


Execution

Running the Server
 - In the terminal where you compiled the server, execute the server program:

	./uniqueserver

 - You should see output indicating that the server is listening on the specified port.


Running the Client
 - Open a new terminal.
 - Navigate to the directory where you compiled the client.
 - Execute the client program:

	./client

 - The client should connect to the server and start displaying random numbers generated by the server.




Test

Test Case 1: Server Startup
Objective: Verify that the server starts and listens on the specified port.

Test Case 2: Client Connection
Objective: Verify that the client can connect to the server.

Test Case 3: Multiple Clients
Objective: Verify that the server can handle multiple clients.

Test Case 4: Shared memory
Objective: Verify that the shared memory is created or not.
